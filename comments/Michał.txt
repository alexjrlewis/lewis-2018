Abstract
-----------

"a sample of 64 ultra-red galaxies formation the S2CLS and S2COSMOS
imaging surveys"

formation -> in?

-----------
1 INTRODUCTION
-----------

First paragraph:
"a given DSFG is capable of producing a Mstars ~ 1011-M galaxy"

Remove "galaxy" or change "a Mstars ~ 1011-M galaxy" to "~ 1011-M of stars"

Sixth paragraph:
"Over-Dense regions are thought"

Dense-> dense

Second to last paragraph:
'Such traits include being able to determine whether the formation of
the red sequence is happening at a faster rate"

Our ability to determine this is not a trait of galaxies, so rephrase this to
"Such traits include the formation of the red sequence being faster"
Then remove "whether there is" further in this sentence.

Last paragraph:
"in which 1' corresponds to a (proper) distance of ≈ 0.5Mpc at z = 3"

distance -> diameter

-----------
2.2 PACS and SPIRE Photometry
-----------

First paragraph:
Give the link when you mention the Herschel Database in Marseille.

Second paragraph:
More details needed here. Do you fit only at the positions of a given
SCUBA2 source? If so, why do you have 6 parameters (ra,dec,flux, …)?
It seems that you fit two positions, but this is not explained. For
the next SCUBA2 source do you use the map with the brighter one
subtracted? This is not ideal, as it would be better to fit all the
sources simultaneously (at least those overlapping).

"The resulting two-dimensional fits were then subtracted from their
respective Herschel images – effectively deblending the Herschel
images using a Scuba-2 prior"

If you fit one source at a time, then this is not deblending.

"Finally, we made no attempt to fit multiple gaussians to the Herschel
images in cases where the Scuba-2 detections are within a Scuba-2 PSF
of each other."

Do you have SCUBA2 sources closer to each other than a SCUBA2 beam?
This is weird. Don't you mean Herschel beam?

-----------
2.4 FIR Photometric Redshifts
-----------

I would add "and physical properties" to the section title, as this is
what you derive towards the end.

Fourth paragraph:
"The general 850-um selected population peaks at z ~ 2, whilst the
ultra-red galaxy sample presented here is shifted to z ~ 3 -
reinforcing the effectiveness of this colour-selection technique"

I don't see that this reinforces the effectiveness of the selection,
because you got this result by construction. You selected red sources
and you assumed normal (~40 K) dust temperature for them, so you are
guaranteed to get high redshifts. The true reinforcement would be the
high redshift measured independently. Otherwise this may be due to too
high temperature assumed, or problems with photometry.

Second paragraph:
"would be need to be scaled down"

would be -> would

"If the IMF were top heavy"

were -> was

-----------
3.1 Galaxy-Centric Over-Density
-----------

The right-hand side of Eq 6 doesn't give the unit of distance, so
something is wrong.

Third paragraph:
"varies from 4.9' < Reff < 3.8'."

from -> between
Reverse the inequality sign (or swap 4.9 and 3.8).

-----------
3.2 Proximity to Closest Over-Density Peak
-----------

Second paragraph:
"which I used to search"

I -> we

-----------
3.3 Previously Identified Proto-Clusters
-----------

First bullet point:
"at the heart this Casey et al. structure)"

this Casey et al. -> of this

Rest of the bullet point:
Note that there are no ultra-reds in these proto-clusters (if this is true).

-----------
3.5 FIR Total Dust Masses and SFRs
-----------

Third paragraph:
"the ‘missing’ number of galaxies"
->
"the  number of ‘missing’ galaxies"

-----------
Fig 4
-----------

"I show contours"

I -> we

-----------
4 OPTICAL/NIR ANALYSIS
-----------

"is their any dependence"

their -> there

-----------
4.1 Optical/NIR Data Acquisition
-----------

First paragraph:
"presented within this chapter" ->
"in this paper"

Second to last paragraph:
"LBGs around ultra-red galaxies at z ~ 3 should have limited-to-no data"

data -> flux
(otherwise you claim that there was no data coverage at these positions)

"To further increase the completeness of this sample"

completeness -> robustness
(you decrease the completeness when you remove sources from the catalogue)

-----------
Figure 7
-----------

From the caption it is unclear what the red histogram on the right
panel is. Are these FIR redshifts of all DSFG? If so, then the
mismatch at z~1 is the result of the problem we discussed at some
point - the K-band catalogue is to dense, so you are guaranteed to
find many wrong associations if you don't use information at other
wavelengths.

I would remove "Fainter" at the top. It doesn't add much.

"Fainter apparent K-band magnitudes correspond to brighter galaxies."

This is wrong. Do you mean *Lower* magnitudes? If so, this is trivial,
so remove.

-----------
Figure 8
-----------

"Potential counterparts with LRs less than LR < 1, have FIR
photometric redshifts that are significantly higher than the
optical/NIR ones"

To be precise, counterparts have optical redshifts, not FIR redshifts,
so I would rephrase this to.
"Potential counterparts with LRs less than LR < 1, have optical/NIR
photometric redshifts that are significantly lower than the FIR
redshifts

I don't understand what the colour-scale means. The colour bar goes to
100%, so in what sense are the blue pixels 100%?

-----------
4.2 Robust Counterparts to DSFGs
-----------

Second bullet point:
"‘total(K, z)’ image, which contains a contribution from the
‘background’ galaxies and from the ‘real’ counterparts"

But most of these galaxies will be in the foreground not background
wrt to the DSFGs (as demonstrated on Fig 8).

Footnote 8:
"i.e. apertures containing no containing no galaxies"

Remove "no containing".

Second to last paragraph:
"after the centre of its search radius had be randomly tweaked."

Say by how much, as the offset needs to be large enough so that you
are not within the same environment anymore.

-----------
4.3 Stellar Masses and Absolute Colours of LBGs
-----------

Last paragraph:
"to given ultra-red galaxy"

given -> a given

"Thus, the contribution from surrounding LBGs is definitely not insignificant"

It is unclear the contribution to what you are referring to.

-----------
Figure 9
-----------

"This increasing average stellar mass"

increasing -> decreasing

-----------
4.3.1 Stellar Masses
-----------

Second paragraph:
"(due to the multiplicity of DSFGs),"

I would change
DSFGs -> submm-selected sources
because galaxies do not have multiplicity - this is a property of
sources selected in submm maps, which may be in fact blends of several
galaxies.

Last paragraph:
"Thus, the potential total z ~ 0 stellar mass of these candidate
protoclusters is ~ 8x1011M"

It is unclear how you got this value of 8e11.

-----------
Figure 10
-----------

It is unclear from the captions how the histograms were calculated.

"a younger stellar at these distant epochs"

stellar -> stellar population

The last sentence in the caption is truncated.

-----------
4.3.2 Absolute Colours
-----------

Second to last paragraph:
"in the top-panel of Fig. 10, we show the approximate locations of the
red/blue sequences and the socalled ‘green valley’ at z < 1 and 2 < z
< 5, each modelled as a Gaussian distribution"

You need to add details on how these distributions were calculated.

-----------
5 CONCLUSION
-----------

Last paragraph:
"that my association probability has failed to associate"

my -> our
