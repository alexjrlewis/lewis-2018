Hi Alex,

please find below my comments on the paper draft  - nice work!
My main concern is, that the answer to the question you raise in Sect 4.3.3 
is clearly YES (dust may explain the colours too). But the title and the conclusion
of the paper does not reflect this reservation.

Abstract:
what about numbers for the over densities both for 
LBGs and SMGs compared to the field (how significant is this finding)

"predominately residing near the centres (< a few megaparsec) of over-densities."
avoid to use twice “over-densities” - reword (e.g. predominantly residing near (<few Mpc) the
central ultra-red source.)

spell out ETG (do not use abbreviations in the abstract)

You apparently do not take any mass evolution from z=3 to z=0 into account
for the last statement in the abstract. But I feel this should be done
to get a more realistic M* estimate by z=0.


Sect 2.1
last sentence, numbers for SNR > 3.5 and 4.0 are swapped

Sect 2.3
it remains unclear to me how you can do 10000 realisations of the
SPIRE photometry for a given source. wouldn't this lead to a maximum a 
few different solutions since you are fitting the same data all the
time? Presumably I didn’t get the point here.

What justifies the cut at Pur > 35%? naively I would expect that this 
should be > 50% to justify that a source is called red.
Ok,I see that you address this point just below. but what remains puzzling is,
that you appear to set this limit such that you still have a significant sample
size without bothering too much if these source are indeed still ultra-red.
Doesn't this imply a strong bias in the source selection?

Sect 2.4
I think it would help to explain how the total set of the 2810 sources was 
constructed. is there a Scuba-2 SNR cut involved or is this based on a significant
detection in N SPIRE/PACS bands?

the integral between 8-1000mu is the IR luminosity, not FIR (FIR is 40-120mu 
according to the definition in Helou ea 1985)
Kennicut 1998 gives 5.8e9 not 1.7e10 for the conversion between LFIR and SFR.
is the difference the IR/FIR definition (?, looks unlikely to me give that this
is a factor 3)

Sect 3.1:
Why is does fidelity parameter should have a Gaussian shape around the central
source? To me this weighing by projected distance from the central source 
appears poorly justified.

It should be made clearer, that the over-densities are measured at 850micron,
not at SPIRE wavelength (if I got this correctly)

It would be interesting to discuss if/how the clustering is related to your Pur 
parameter. Not only to test that ultra-redness is a relevant parameter here, but
also because the mean redshift changes with Pur.


Sect 3.3:
Given that most of the photo-clusters discussed here do not contain ultra-red
sources you should briefly mention how the computation of the over density parameter
was done in this cases (I assume centering on the proto-cluster and using the same
Reff)


Concerning the z=5.3 over density:
is COSMOS- AxTEC-3 an ultra-red source according to your criteria?
I think its nevertheless interesting to discuss if there are potentially additional
sources in the wider environment around this known proto cluster based on your 
over-density analysis. 

Mention explicitly that you do not find an over-density for the Hung ea and 
GOODS-N clusters. (I assume this is the outcome of this analysis)

Sect 3.4:
I think its ok to discuss the different effects on nu_rest/nu_obs in a PhD, but
discussing here the strong gravitational field effect sounds over the top to me
(in particular since you are analysing z_photo's here)


Sect 3.5:
numbers in the text do not match the numbers in the caption 
to Fig 6 (e.g. SFR 1100 vs 1400).

Isn't it common practice to estimate the "missing" sources with a 
completeness function? maybe add a statement why this was not done
in this analysis.

Sect 4.1
"by the ultra-red galaxies presented within this chapter. " PhD left over


Sect 4.3.1
There must be numerical predictions on how this stellar mass evolves
from z=3 to z=0. I think it would be worth adding this to get a feeling 
for a more realistic M* at z=0

Fig 9:
"This increasing average stellar mass with radius suggests .."
increasing => decreasing


Sect 4.3.2:
Maybe it would be also worth to mention at the end of this section that the
larger stellar mass of the LBGs closer to the ultra-red galaxies also
hints towards a more metal (=dust) enriched environment via the mass
metallicity relation.

Somehow the conclusion from this section is not taken into account
in the title, nor in the conclusions of the paper. If a reasonable
amount of dust reddening can explain the color difference in the LBGs, where
is then the base for claiming that the red sequence emerges faster in
these over densities?


Fig 10 top:  unclear where the location of the blue/red sequence and
    the green valley locations for the redshifts come from - is this from
    a semi-analytic model? add references or give more details.

Conclusions:
“Thus, we have shown that there is a sizeable contribution from LBGs to 
these high-redshift systems signposted by ultra-red galaxies.”

Given that all these results are based on photo_z’s I feel that “we have shown” is
much too strong. FIR photo-z are very poor…
